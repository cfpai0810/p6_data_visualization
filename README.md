# Loan Dataset Exploration
## by Chun-Feng Pai


## Dataset

> This dataset consists of 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rates (or interest rates), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> During my exploratory analysis, I select several categorical variables and numeric variables for bivariate and multivariate analysis. The main findings include the negative correlation between interest rates and income, credit grades, and prosepr socres. As for the relationship between interest rates and loan amounts, it was not so clear due to the huge amount of data of loans below 10000 dollars in this dataset. However, the trend becomes more obvious when further analysis is done based on the credit grades. I also find income is not the only factors banks consider when assign the scores. Overall, the income still serves as a good indicator to determine the interest rates and loan amounts.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation, we can find the loan highly concentrated on small loans with wide range of interest rates. Then when we investigate the correlation among income, credit grades, loan amount and interest rates. The relationship between loan amount and credit grades is positive, whereas the correlation between interest rates and credit grades is negative. The first bivariate investigate aligns with my expectation that the borrowers' higher grade enables a borrower to borrow more money with lower cost. Then I add another variable income range to the analytical models to see how it plays a role in the loan. It turns out that our observed relationship becomes more salient when the income range is higher.
